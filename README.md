Safarweetbot
============

Using Tweetbot ? Then you'll probably like this :
![Safarweetbot](http://cl.ly/image/432V1z3f0F3i/Safarweetbot.gif)


Supported configuration
-----------

I've only used it with the latest version of Safari (*Version 7.0.2 (9537.74.9)*)
and Tweetbot (*Version 1.5 (150002)*).

However, Tweetbot supports URL schemes since *Version 1.0.2*, and I think older
versions of Safari should work too - and I have nothing but my **HUGE and IMPRESSIVE** :rolleye: knowledge of JS and Safari extensions to coroborate this.
I'd love to hear feedback though :-).

If you want to make it work with your favorite browser, feel free to download
the source code and tweak it as you want (see *Licence* below).


Install & Configuration
------------

Simply download the [Safarweetbot.safariextz](https://github.com/DCMaxxx/Safarweetbot/raw/master/Safarweetbot.safariextz) file and
double click ton install it.
You can also install it by adding the Safaweetbot.safariextension folder to
extension builder in Safari - see [Apple's instructions](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html).

You can access Safarweetbot's settings through Safari's preferences :

* Safari->Preferences->Extensions->Safarweetbot

Current options :

* **Automatically close window :** closes the window once Tweetbot has opened the
link.


Contribution
-----------

I've only done URL scheme that I often use - username, statuses.
There are [a lot of different schemes](http://tapbots.com/blog/development/tweetbot-url-scheme) and if you want to implement it, please make a pull request :-).
